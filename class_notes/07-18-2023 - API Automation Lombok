    Swagger:

        It's an open source tool that offers a documentation for API. So from Swagger, we can get any information we need directly without interacting from the developer tools.

    RestAssured:

        It's a Java library that helps sending request and receiving reposes for the RESTful web services.

    POJO:

        Stands for Plain Old Java Object it's helping us to store Objects from the JSON body and we usually employ encapsulation to create readability and re-usability.

    Serialization:

        It is a process of converting our Java Object to JSON format, so we can use it in our request body. We are reaching serialization using faster.xml Jackson library using its ObjectMapper class.

    De-serialization:

        It is a process of converting JSON object to Java object. So by retrieving each attribute inside the JSON body, we can validate the objects that we need.

    Hamcrest:

        Hamcrest is an assertion library that is integrating well with RestAssured and helping us to chain assertions inside any API call. It's reducing the time and the effort for assertion.

    faster.xml Jackson:

        The tool that is helping us to reach serialization.
