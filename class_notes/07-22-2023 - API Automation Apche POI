    Lombok - Project Lombok

        Lombok and its annotation giving us a clean and readible bean POJO classes by writing less code.

        @Data

            The @Data is a special annotation from Project Lombok. It helps us to keep our code clean and tidy
            
            By marking a class @Data, you will get:
            - Automatically generated getter and setter methods for all our variables
            
            So, instead of writing all these methods ourselves, we can simply use @Data and it does the work for us!


        @Builder

            The @Builder annotation helping us to assign values to our fields in another class without needing creating an object from the class
